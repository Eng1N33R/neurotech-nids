# NeuroTech

**NeuroTech** is a network traffic analysis utility powered by deep learning
with TensorFlow. With accuracy ratios of more than 85%, it's able to adapt to
any environments and network conditions.

NeuroTech runs on Python 3.5.2. It also requires `argus` to be set up and
running as a daemon on port 561, as well as a functioning `ra` client.

### Module overview

#### learn
Generates datasets from current real network traffic under normal conditions.

#### train
Trains the neural network from a dataset (generated by `learn` or the base dataset).

#### test
Tests neural network accuracy against a test dataset. Shows the accuracy ratio.

#### capture
Captures and analyses current real network traffic.
